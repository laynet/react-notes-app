## Overview

### Summary

A very simple react CRUD app using local storage. The notes app lets the user type a note in markup and preview it. The most recently edited note will jump to the top of the sidebar.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Create-react-app
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-mde](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mde) - React markdown-editor
- [React-showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-showdown) - Render React components within markdown and markdown as React components!
- [React-split](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-split) - Easily render a re-sizeable split frame

### Continued development

This would be fun to style more on the front end or add an actual backend to
